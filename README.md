On-Chain Guard

Hey there! I‚Äôm Vaishnavi, and this is On-Chain Guard‚Äîa full-stack project that combines Web3 and machine learning to flag suspicious Ethereum wallets and visualize their activity over time.

üöÄ What it Is

I built this because I wanted a simple way to spot ‚Äúweird‚Äù wallets on Ethereum (or Polygon, etc.) without diving into raw logs. Under the hood:

‚Ä¢ FastAPI serves up wallet anomaly scores and transfer history.
‚Ä¢ Isolation Forest (from scikit-learn) is our anomaly detector‚Äîtrained on historical wallet features.
‚Ä¢ Next.js frontend (with SWR + Recharts) gives you:
‚Äì A dashboard of the top-N suspicious wallets
‚Äì Click-through to a wallet‚Äôs detail page
‚Äì A time-series chart of its anomaly score evolution
‚Ä¢ ETL scripts pull on-chain data, compute features, train the model, and backfill history

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

1. Clone & Configure
   git clone [https://github.com/vaishnavigavi/onchain-guard.git](https://github.com/vaishnavigavi/onchain-guard.git)
   cd onchain-guard
   Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your keys:
   ALCHEMY\_API\_URL=your-polygon-or-eth-rpc
   NEXTAUTH\_URL=[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   NEXT\_PUBLIC\_API\_BASE\_URL=[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

2. ETL & Model
   This pipeline:
   ‚Äì Fetches recent on-chain transfers
   ‚Äì Computes per-wallet features (volume, flow ratios, etc.)
   ‚Äì Trains an IsolationForest
   ‚Äì Dumps wallet\_features.parquet, wallet\_anomalies.parquet, and model/isolation\_forest.pkl
   To run it:
   docker-compose up etl

3. API Backend
   docker-compose up api
   Health check:  GET [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)
   List top anomalies:  GET [http://localhost:8000/anomalies?top\_n=50](http://localhost:8000/anomalies?top_n=50)
   Single wallet:       GET [http://localhost:8000/anomaly/{wallet}](http://localhost:8000/anomaly/{wallet})
   History:             GET [http://localhost:8000/anomaly-history/{wallet}](http://localhost:8000/anomaly-history/{wallet})

4. Frontend
   docker-compose up frontend
   Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see:
   ‚Äì Dashboard of top suspicious wallets
   ‚Äì Wallet pages with detail, anomaly-over-time chart, and recent transfers

üîç What‚Äôs Inside

‚Ä¢ scripts/   ETL and model-training code
‚Ä¢ data/      Parquet files for wallet features and anomaly scores
‚Ä¢ model/     Trained IsolationForest .pkl
‚Ä¢ app.py     FastAPI app serving anomalies and history
‚Ä¢ frontend/  Next.js app with App Router, SWR, and Recharts
‚Ä¢ docker-compose.yml   Orchestrates ETL, API, and frontend

‚öôÔ∏è Extending & Deploying

1. Add new features by updating the ETL scripts
2. Retrain by rerunning docker-compose up etl
3. Deploy by pointing your Docker setup at your cloud provider and setting env vars
4. Auth is stubbed for wallet-signature login‚Äîfeel free to hook up NextAuth or OAuth

ü§ù Feedback & Contributions

This is a one-person project and I‚Äôm always eager to hear what you think. Open an issue or message me on GitHub if you run into anything.

Enjoy poking around on-chain data without drowning in raw JSON!
